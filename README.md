ECE385 lab from UIUC
If you are from the same course, please don't copy our code, we will not be held responsible for your guys' cheating.

The final project has been completed.
# Avalon
Our final project is about 1st person 2.5-D game. You can control our hero(Saber) to fight with monsters.

- key control
--WSAD: moving
--J: normal attack
--K: Excalibur
--L: pose
We modified the key control part so that our game can deal with 4 key presses simultaneously.(even though you may just need 3)

- How to win
There are 5 rounds of fighting in Avalon. If you kill all the monsters, you win the game.
If you loses all health or let any monsters cross the brige, you lose the game.


# How to run
Pip all the codes in your computer and compile in the Quartus.
